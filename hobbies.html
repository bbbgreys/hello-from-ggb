         <p align = "center"> 
            There are so many things that I like to do in my life.<br>
            I love painting, drawing, singing, vlogging, cooking and talking.<br>
            I learned how to draw when I was in elementary. I started using color pencil<br>
            I also tried watercolor pencil then used watercolor when I was in junior high school.<br>
            In senior high school, I learned to make portraits using graphite and charcoal <br>
            Right now, I am trying to use different medium like digital, oil, acrylic, etc.<br><br>
            I learned how to cook, when I started living in dorm. I had to learn and I really<br>
            enjoyed cooking for me and my friends! I just watch youtube videos or search on google<br>
            if I want to cook something. I'm so glad that people like what I cook.<br><br>
            I started singing since I was a kid. Everyone in our family knows how to sing.<br>
            I sang in church and sometimes cover some songs with my cousin. I sometimes upload them<br>
            on my youtube channel. I love taking videos and editing. I am planning on having<br>
            my own art exhibit in the future!
