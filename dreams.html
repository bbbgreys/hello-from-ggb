      <h1 id="top" align="center">WELCOME TO MY DREAMS!</h1> <br><br>
        <p align = "center"> 
            When I was a child I dreamt of being a CPA lawyer, because<br>
            my mother's job was accounting, but she quit because she<br>
            wants to take care of us, her children. It was my dream until<br>
            college. I also dreamt of being an architect or designer because<br>
            I really like arts and design but, I did not pursue any course<br>
            related to it because I know that it is expensive and I do not<br>
            want to add more expenses and bills. Although I am not studying arts<br>
            right now, I still love arts and still making art commissions. <br>
            I am also thinking how I am going to apply my talents and skills<br>
            to my degree program.
