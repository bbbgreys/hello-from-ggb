      <h1 id="top" align="center">HI, THIS IS ME!</h1> <br><br>
      <h2 align="center">NAME</h1>
         <p align = "center"> 
            Hello! My name is Baby Grace P. Garganera. <br>
            Yep! Baby, like a baby in the tummy. (●◕‿◕●)✿

      <h2 align="center">NICKNAME</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            People call me different names. <br>
            Most of the time, if we are not close, they call me 'Grace' <br>
            My professors also call me 'Grace', I think it's too formal. <br>
            Some friends call me 'Baby Grace' or 'Baby G' <br>
            Most of the time, people call me 'BBG', it sounds like 'Baby G' <br>
            You can call me any of these nicknames. <br>

      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE COMSCI SUBJECT</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            My favorite computer science subject is CMSC 12.<br>
            I am not fond of programming, but I enjoyed CMSC 12.<br>
            Rigt now, I am still trying to love comsci.<br>
            I also enjoyed other subjects, it always depends on our prof. <br>
            There are times that I want to learn or curious,<br>
            but I'm shy/afraid to ask. :< <br>
         </p><br><br>
      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE GE</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            My favorite GE subject is Arts 1.<br>
            I am into arts. I love anything related to arts or design.<br>
            My Arts 1 class was the best! Our Professor, made sure <br>
            that we always understand the lessons. <br>
            It feels comfortable participating in the class.<br>
            It's sad that we had to stop our face to face class.<br>
            I enjoyed making my Arts 1 portfolio!<br>
         </p><br><br>
      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            My favorite programming language is python.<br>
            I am not sure if it is really my favorite prog. language,<br>
            or I still have not found my favorite one. <br>
            All I know is that, python is very comforting. <br>
            It is easier to understand than other languages.<br>
            Maybe I like Python because it is where I loved programming.<br>
         </p><br><br>
      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE FOOD</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            One of may favorite foods is carbonara/creamy carbonara.<br>
            It's been both my comfort food and happy food since high school. <br>
            I learned to cook carbonara when I was in senior high school. <br>
            I always cook carbonara for my friends, family and orgmates! <br>
            I'm so happy that they loved it and they even asked how to cook it!
