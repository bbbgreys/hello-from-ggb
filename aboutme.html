            People call me different names. <br>
            Most of the time, if we are not close, they call me 'Grace' <br>
            My professors also call me 'Grace', I think it's too formal. <br>
            Some friends call me 'Baby Grace' or 'Baby G' <br>
            Most of the time, people call me 'BBG', it sounds like 'Baby G' <br>
            You can call me any of these nicknames. <br>

      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE COMSCI SUBJECT</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            My favorite computer science subject is CMSC 12.<br>
            I am not fond of programming, but I enjoyed CMSC 12.<br>
            Rigt now, I am still trying to love comsci.<br>
            I also enjoyed other subjects, it always depends on our prof. <br>
            There are times that I want to learn or curious,<br>
            but I'm shy/afraid to ask. :< <br>
         </p><br><br>
      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE GE</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            My favorite GE subject is Arts 1.<br>
            I am into arts. I love anything related to arts or design.<br>
            My Arts 1 class was the best! Our Professor, made sure <br>
            that we always understand the lessons. <br>
            It feels comfortable participating in the class.<br>
            It's sad that we had to stop our face to face class.<br>
            I enjoyed making my Arts 1 portfolio!<br>
         </p><br><br>
      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            My favorite programming language is python.<br>
            I am not sure if it is really my favorite prog. language,<br>
            or I still have not found my favorite one. <br>
            All I know is that, python is very comforting. <br>
            It is easier to understand than other languages.<br>
            Maybe I like Python because it is where I loved programming.<br>
         </p><br><br>
      <h2 align="center">FAVORITE FOOD</h2>
         <p align = "center"> 
            One of may favorite foods is carbonara/creamy carbonara.<br>
            It's been both my comfort food and happy food since high school. <br>
            I learned to cook carbonara when I was in senior high school. <br>
            I always cook carbonara for my friends, family and orgmates! <br>
            I'm so happy that they loved it and they even asked how to cook it!
         </p>
       <h2 align="center">MY HOBBIES</h2>
	<p align = "center"> 
            There are so many things that I like to do in my life.<br>
            I love painting, drawing, singing, vlogging, cooking and talking.<br>
            I learned how to draw when I was in elementary. I started using color pencil<br>
            I also tried watercolor pencil then used watercolor when I was in junior high school.<br>
            In senior high school, I learned to make portraits using graphite and charcoal <br>
            Right now, I am trying to use different medium like digital, oil, acrylic, etc.<br><br>
            I learned how to cook, when I started living in dorm. I had to learn and I really<br>
            enjoyed cooking for me and my friends! I just watch youtube videos or search on google<br>
            if I want to cook something. I'm so glad that people like what I cook.<br><br>
            I started singing since I was a kid. Everyone in our family knows how to sing.<br>
            I sang in church and sometimes cover some songs with my cousin. I sometimes upload them<br>
            on my youtube channel. I love taking videos and editing. I am planning on having<br>
            my own art exhibit in the future! 
        </p> 
      <h2 align="center">MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS</h2>
	<p align = "center"> 
            When I was a child I dreamt of being a CPA lawyer, because<br>
            my mother's job was accounting, but she quit because she<br>
            wants to take care of us, her children. It was my dream until<br>
            college. I also dreamt of being an architect or designer because<br>
            I really like arts and design but, I did not pursue any course<br>
            related to it because I know that it is expensive and I do not<br>
            want to add more expenses and bills. Although I am not studying arts<br>
            right now, I still love arts and still making art commissions. <br>
            I am also thinking how I am going to apply my talents and skills<br>
            to my degree program.
